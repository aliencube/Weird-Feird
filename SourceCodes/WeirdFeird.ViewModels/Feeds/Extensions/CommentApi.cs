This is documented in [Chris Sells' Specification](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/spout/default.aspx?content=archive.htm#exposingRssComments). Note that for quite a while this page has had a typo and erroneously referred to this element as 'commentRSS' as opposed to the correct 'commentRss'. Feed consumers should be aware that they may run into both spellings in the wild. Please see [this page](http://intertwingly.net/blog/2006/04/15/commentRss) for more information.
